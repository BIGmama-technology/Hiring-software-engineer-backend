## Backend software engineer test

The principal objective of this project is to evaluate the applicant's ability to learn new skills on the fly, build reliable backend in adherence to best practices in different languages and colaborate with peer programers.

The test consists of implementing a **reliable communication stream protocol based on UDP**  (User Datagram Protocol). 

The implementation should follow a protocol standard like [RUDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_User_Datagram_Protocol). 


## How does this work ?

Below is a list of tasks that candidates concurently work on. If you deem your contribution to be complete, you can create a pull request. 
The team will review your contribution and provide feedback. If its good your branch will be merged with the `main` branch.
Tasks that are done will be ommited and new tasks will apear for others.
Candidates with merged changes will be invited to pass an interview with the team.


## Who can apply ?

Both students looking for an internship at BIGmama and professionals looking for a full-time position can apply.


## Tasks

#### 1. Package development:
   - The repository should be a package that could be used by application.
   - The package language is not fixed, you can chose whatever you want (Python and GoLang are preffered).

#### 2. RUDP implementation:
   - The package should provide an API to create and use RUDP connections.
   - The protocol should implement reliability and flow control (prefferably configurable for different kinds of applications)

#### 3. Tests:
   - Add unit tests for different components of the package.

#### 2. Examples:
   - Include example codes for differents kinds of applications: peer-to-peer, server-client etc...
