## Backend software engineer test : implementation of RUDP

The principal objective of this project is to evaluate the applicant's ability to learn new skills on the fly, build reliable backend in adherence to best practices in different languages and colaborate with peer programers.

The test consists of implementing a **reliable communication stream protocol based on UDP** (User Datagram Protocol). 

The implementation should follow a protocol standard like [RUDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliable_User_Datagram_Protocol). 

## How does this work ?

Candidates with merged changes will be invited to pass an interview with the team.

## Who can apply ?

Both students looking for an internship at BIGmama and professionals looking for a full-time position can apply.

## Tasks

Using Python (sockets/asyncio):
